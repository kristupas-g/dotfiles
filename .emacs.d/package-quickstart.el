Pop up a posframe to show STRING at POSITION.

 (1) POSITION

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx

   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
10. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'
19. `posframe-poshandler-point-frame-center'

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) CURSOR and WINDOW-POINT

By default, cursor is not showed in posframe, user can let cursor
showed with this argument help by set its value to a `cursor-type'.

When cursor need to be showed in posframe, user may need to set
WINDOW-POINT to the point of BUFFER, which can let cursor showed
at this point.

 (11) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (12) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (13) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (14) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (15) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (17) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (18) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (19) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other appliction
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

C-x g           magit-status
C-x M-g         magit-dispatch
C-c M-g         magit-file-dispatch

These bindings may be added when `after-init-hook' is run.
Each binding is added if and only if at that time no other key
is bound to the same command and no other command is bound to
the same key.  In other words we try to avoid adding bindings
that are unnecessary, as well as bindings that conflict with
other bindings.

Adding the above bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook'
is called to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their
init file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit'
is loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that
all the potentially conflicting user bindings have already
been added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

Setting this variable to nil has no effect if that is done after
the key bindings have already been added.

We recommend that you bind \"C-c g\" instead of \"C-c M-g\" to
`magit-file-dispatch'.  The former is a much better binding
but the \"C-c <letter>\" namespace is strictly reserved for
users; preventing Magit from using it by default.

In the latter two cases the upstream is also set.  Whether it is

Create and checkout a new branch starting at and tracking the

upstream or no unpushed commits, then the new branch is created
anyway and the previously current branch is not touched.

This is useful to create a feature branch after work has already
began on the old branch (likely but not necessarily \"master\").

If the current branch is a member of the value of option
`magit-branch-prefer-remote-upstream' (which see), then the
current branch will be used as the starting point as usual, but
the upstream of the starting-point may be used as the upstream
of the new branch, instead of the starting-point itself.

If optional FROM is non-nil, then the source branch is reset
to `FROM~', instead of to the last commit it shares with its
upstream.  Interactively, FROM is only ever non-nil, if the
region selects some commits, and among those commits, FROM is
the commit that is the fewest commits ahead of the source
branch.

The commit at the other end of the selection actually does not
matter, all commits between FROM and `HEAD' are moved to the new

(autoload 'general-define-key "general" "\
The primary key definition function provided by general.el.

Define MAPS, optionally using DEFINER, in the keymap(s) corresponding to STATES
and KEYMAPS.

MAPS consists of paired keys (vectors or strings; also see
`general-implicit-kbd') and definitions (those mentioned in `define-key''s
docstring and general.el's \"extended\" definitions). All pairs (when not
ignored) will be recorded and can be later displayed with
`general-describe-keybindings'.

If DEFINER is specified, a custom key definer will be used to bind MAPS. See
general.el's documentation/README for more information.

Unlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be
quoted (this allows using the keymap name for other purposes, e.g. deferring
keybindings if the keymap symbol is not bound, optionally inferring the
corresponding major mode for a symbol by removing \"-map\" for :which-key,
easily storing the keymap name for use with `general-describe-keybindings',
etc.). Note that general.el provides other key definer macros that do not
require quoting keymaps.

STATES corresponds to the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users
should not set STATES. When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key*' will be
used (the evil auxiliary keymaps corresponding STATES and KEYMAPS will be used);
otherwise `define-key' will be used (unless DEFINER is specified). KEYMAPS
defaults to 'global. There is also 'local, which create buffer-local
keybindings for both evil and non-evil keybindings. There are other special,
user-alterable \"shorthand\" symbols for keymaps and states (see
`general-keymap-aliases' and `general-state-aliases').

Note that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be lists or single symbols. If any
keymap does not exist, those keybindings will be deferred until the keymap does
exist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this function.

PREFIX corresponds to a key to prefix keys in MAPS with and defaults to none. To
bind/unbind a key specified with PREFIX, \"\" can be specified as a key in
MAPS (e.g. ...:prefix \"SPC\" \"\" nil... will unbind space).

The keywords in this paragraph are only useful for evil users. If
NON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used instead of PREFIX for
states in `general-non-normal-states' (e.g. the emacs and insert states). This
argument will only have an effect if one of these states is in STATES or if
corresponding global keymap (e.g. `evil-insert-state-map') is in KEYMAPS.
Alternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to
bind keys in all states under the specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX,
GLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX from applying to `general-non-normal-states'.
INFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is
potentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so
that you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in
MAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a
wrapper function/macro so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify
all of them. If none of the other prefix keyword arguments are specified, INFIX
will have no effect.

If PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP is specified, a prefix command and/or keymap
will be created. PREFIX-NAME can be additionally specified to set the keymap
menu name/prompt. If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, `define-prefix-command' will
be used. Otherwise, only a prefix keymap will be created. Previously created
prefix commands/keymaps will never be redefined/cleared. All prefixes (including
the INFIX key, if specified) will then be bound to PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP.
If the user did not specify any PREFIX or manually specify any KEYMAPS, general
will bind all MAPS in the prefix keymap corresponding to either PREFIX-MAP or
PREFIX-COMMAND instead of in the default keymap.

PREDICATE corresponds to a predicate to check to determine whether a definition
should be active (e.g. \":predicate '(eobp)\"). Definitions created with a
predicate will only be active when the predicate is true. When the predicate is
false, key lookup will continue to search for a match in lower-precedence
keymaps.

In addition to the normal definitions supported by `define-key', general.el also
provides \"extended\" definitions, which are plists containing the normal
definition as well as other keywords. For example, PREDICATE can be specified
globally or locally in an extended definition. New global (~general-define-key~)
and local (extended definition) keywords can be added by the user. See
`general-extended-def-keywords' and general.el's documentation/README for more
information.

PACKAGE is the global version of the extended definition keyword that specifies
the package a keymap is defined in (used for \"autoloading\" keymaps)

PROPERTIES, REPEAT, and JUMP are the global versions of the extended definition
keywords used for adding evil command properties to commands.

MAJOR-MODES, WK-MATCH-KEYS, WK-MATCH-BINDINGS, and WK-FULL-KEYS are the
corresponding global versions of which-key extended definition keywords. They
will only have an effect for extended definitions that specify :which-key or
:wk. See the section on extended definitions in the general.el
documentation/README for more information.

LISPY-PLIST and WORF-PLIST are the global versions of extended definition
keywords that are used for each corresponding custom DEFINER.

This uses an extended menu item's capability of dynamically computing a

benefits and downsides of `general-key'.

KEY should be a string given in `kbd' notation and should correspond to a single

up KEY with STATE as the current evil state. When specified, DOCSTRING will be
the menu item's name/description.

(general-key \"some key\"
  :let ((some-var some-val)))

Create and return a command that simulates KEYS in STATE and KEYMAP.

`general-key' should be prefered over this whenever possible as it is simpler
and has saner functionality in many cases because it does not rely on
`unread-command-events' (e.g. \"C-h k\" will show the docstring of the command
to be simulated ; see the readme for more information). The main downsides of
`general-key' are that it cannot simulate a command followed by keys or
subsequent commands, and which-key does not currently work well with it when
simulating a prefix key/incomplete key sequence.

KEYS should be a string given in `kbd' notation. It can also be a list of a
single command followed by a string of the key(s) to simulate after calling that
command. STATE should only be specified by evil users and should be a quoted
evil state. KEYMAP should not be quoted. Both STATE and KEYMAP aliases are
supported (but they have to be set when the macro is expanded). When neither
STATE or KEYMAP are specified, the key(s) will be simulated in the current
context.

If NAME is specified, it will replace the automatically generated function name.
NAME should not be quoted. If DOCSTRING is specified, it will replace the
automatically generated docstring.

Normally the generated function will look up KEY in the correct context to try
to match a command. To prevent this lookup, LOOKUP can be specified as nil.
Generally, you will want to keep LOOKUP non-nil because this will allow checking
the evil repeat property of matched commands to determine whether or not they
should be recorded. See the docstring for `general--simulate-keys' for more
information about LOOKUP.

When a WHICH-KEY description is specified, it will replace the command name in
the which-key popup.

When a command name is specified and that command has been remapped (i.e. [remap
command] is currently bound), the remapped version will be used instead of the
original command unless REMAP is specified as nil (it is true by default).

The advantages of this over a keyboard macro are as follows:
- Prefix arguments are supported
- The user can control the context in which the keys are simulated
- The user can simulate both a named command and keys
- The user can simulate an incomplete key sequence (e.g. for a keymap)

Create and return a command that runs FALLBACK-COMMAND or a command in MAPS.
MAPS consists of <key> <command> pairs. If a key in MAPS is matched, the
corresponding command will be run. Otherwise FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run with
the unmatched keys. So, for example, if \"ab\" was pressed, and \"ab\" is not
one of the key sequences from MAPS, the FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run followed by
the simulated keypresses of \"ab\". Prefix arguments will still work regardless
of which command is run. This is useful for binding under non-prefix keys. For
example, this can be used to redefine a sequence like \"cw\" or \"cow\" in evil
but still have \"c\" work as `evil-change'. If TIMEOUT is specified,
FALLBACK-COMMAND will also be run in the case that the user does not press the
next key within the TIMEOUT (e.g. 0.5).

NAME and DOCSTRING are optional keyword arguments. They can be used to replace
the automatically generated name and docstring for the created function. By
default, `cl-gensym' is used to prevent name clashes (e.g. allows the user to
create multiple different commands using `self-insert-command' as the
FALLBACK-COMMAND without explicitly specifying NAME to manually prevent
clashes).

When INHERIT-KEYMAP is specified, all the keybindings from that keymap will be
inherited in MAPS.

When a WHICH-KEY description is specified, it will replace the command name in
the which-key popup.

When command to be executed has been remapped (i.e. [remap command] is currently
bound), the remapped version will be used instead of the original command unless

MAPS corresponds to a list of translations (key replacement pairs). For example,
specifying \"a\" \"b\" will bind \"a\" to \"b\"'s definition in the keymap.
Specifying nil as a replacement will unbind a key.

If DESTRUCTIVE is non-nil, the keymap will be destructively altered without

Search with `grep' for files in DIR where the content matches a regexp.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be
nil, a directory string or a list of file/directory paths.  If
`consult-grep' is called interactively with a prefix argument,
the user can specify the directories or files to search in.
Multiple directories must be separated by comma in the
minibuffer, since they are read via `completing-read-multiple'.
By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.
Otherwise the `default-directory' is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep
input) is passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second
part of the string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is
given as the first character of the input string.  The format is
similar to Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.
Furthermore command line options can be passed to grep, specified
behind --.  The overall prompt input has the form
`#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs
regular expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like
builtin Emacs search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs
regular expressions.  Furthermore the asynchronous input split
into words, each word must match separately and in any order.
See `consult--regexp-compiler' for the inner workings.  In order
to disable transformations of the grep input, adjust
`consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.
